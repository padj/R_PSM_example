# R_PSM_example

This repo contains an example Partitioned survival model (PSM) in R. This repo is created to serve as a methodological example, rather than to determine an accurate ICER. It is written in a functional manner and with emphasis on readers' comprehension and learning, rather than efficiency. 

The example used is Nivolumab versus Ipilimumab in advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma. Data is sourced from the NICE committee papers:

That being said, I might just make up the data if it's easier for me.
